# 4 Pillars
    - Encapsulation
        - Combining related variables and functions into a unit called an objects with the functions called methods and the variables called properties. 
             - EX) a car has the properties of make, model, color and has the methods start(), stop(), and move. 
        - Reduces the need for parameters in methods because variables would be local to the object's methods. It is good to note that it is more conventional to limit the use of parameters. 
    
    - Abstraction
        - EX) Think of a DVD player as an object. The DVD player has a complex logic board inside and a few buttons outside to interact with. You don't have to care about what is going on inside. All the complexity is hidden away from you. 
        - Creates a more simple interface. 
        - Helps reduce the impact of change.

    - Inheritance
        - Helps eliminate redundant code. 
        - Generating properties and methods that will be utilized by other objects. 

    - Polymorphism 
        - Poly means many and morphism means form. So combined, it means many forms.
        - Helps get rid of using a lot of if and else statements and switch cases. 
        - So in programming, it means that an object can have many objects and types. 
        - EX) There's an animal class, which is the parent class and monkey, horse, cheetah subclasses. They would all use the eat() method but due to being different animals would have unique ways of eating. So since they are all animals the subclasses could all inherit the eat() method from the animal class with different parameters.
